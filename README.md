This project provides an Android MQTT Client App Framework:

MQTT stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport and it is a powerful messaging transport protocol mostly used in Machine to Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) communication contexts.
MQTT is preferred in these contexts, because it’s easy to implement and it’s a perfect fit for devices with limited resources.
