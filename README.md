# MQTT Client App
This project provides an Android MQTT Client App Framework:<br>
MQTT stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport and it is a powerful messaging transport protocol mostly used in Machine to Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) communication contexts.<br>
MQTT is preferred in these contexts, because it’s easy to implement and it’s a perfect fit for devices with limited resources.
